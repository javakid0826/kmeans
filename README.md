# kmeans
<b>How do I use it?</b>
1. Install Processing (https://processing.org)
2. The "kmeans.pde" file must be in a folder called "kmeans" without the quotes
3. Double-click the pde file and open it with Processing
4. (Optional) Put the file you want to use into the "kmeans" folder
5. In the source code, change the "filename" variable to your file (if you put it in the same folder all you need is the name of the file without the .png at the end. Otherwise, specify the path to the file)
6. Change the "scale" variable to what you want (the larger it is the faster it will run but it will become more pixelated. lowest value is 1 and you can only use integers)
7. Run the program (Either by pressing the run button at the top or pressing Ctrl+R)
8. At the end it will show your final image on the screen (that is how you know it is done)
9. The file will be saved in the same place as your source image
10. Profit!
